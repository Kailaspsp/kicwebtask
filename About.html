  <p1 style = "color:white;font-size:20px;text-align:rignt;font-family:verdana">A learn-to-fly algorithm works like a baby bird leaving its nest. “Eventually they’ve got to make that jump, and then they
  learn how to control themselves; not just hit the ground, but fly around and navigate their environment.
  The algorithms merge real-time aerodynamic modeling with adaptive controls and real-time guidance, and 
  then model the aerodynamics to steadily improve the control of the vehicle. The algorithms learn by beginning
  with a guess, which is often wrong, about how to control the plane, but they don’t need to know anything about 
  the airplane’s design to start with. As they see the vehicle’s aerodynamics in flight, they can determine what 
  impact its controls have That’s really part of the beauty and the uniqueness of this approach.</p4>
